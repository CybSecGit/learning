## The MCP Revolution

### Why MCP Exists (And Why You Should Care)

Let me explain why MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the best thing to happen to AI since someone figured out that "please" and "thank you" improve response quality.

**The Problem with Current AI:**
```python
# What AI assistants currently look like
class BoringAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capabilities = [
            "talk_about_stuff",
            "generate_text", 
            "answer_questions_badly"
        ]
    
    def do_anything_useful(self):
        return "I can't access external systems, lol"
    
    def help_with_real_work(self):
        return "Here's a generic response that might be completely wrong"
```

This is a minimal test chapter to verify MCP concepts work with MDX compilation.
