## üõ†Ô∏è CDK TypeScript Tools You'll Master

### Core CDK TypeScript Development
- **AWS CDK CLI** - Complete command mastery
- **TypeScript compiler (tsc)** - Advanced configuration
- **Jest** - CDK construct testing framework
- **@aws-cdk/assert** - CDK-specific testing utilities
- **cdk-nag** - TypeScript-based compliance checking

### Advanced CDK TypeScript Tooling
- **CDK Pipelines** - Self-mutating CI/CD in TypeScript
- **CDK Diff** - Advanced change analysis
- **projen** - Advanced CDK TypeScript project management
- **CDK Bundling** - Asset optimization and packaging

### GitHub Actions for CDK TypeScript

- **CDK TypeScript testing** automation
- **Type checking** and linting workflows
- **CDK deployment** with compilation
- **Construct publishing** to npm

---

## üí∞ Cost Management Strategy

### Essential Cost Controls
- **Aggressive teardown discipline** - Treat every deployment like an expensive hotel room
- **Component-wise testing** - Deploy individual pieces, not entire platforms
- **Time-boxed deployments** - 2-4 hour maximum runtime for learning labs
- **AWS Budget alerts** at $25, $50, $100 thresholds
- **Emergency teardown workflows** in GitHub Actions

### Module-Specific Warnings
- **Modules 1-2**: Virtually free with immediate teardown
- **Module 3**: Config rules keep charging - destroy within hours  
- **Module 4**: OpenSearch is expensive - 2-3 hour runtime max
- **Module 5**: CloudFront has propagation delays - budget teardown time
- **Module 6**: Fargate charges by the minute - scale to zero immediately
- **Module 7**: Full platform deployment - component separation is critical

---

## üéì Assessment & Validation
