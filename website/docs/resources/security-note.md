# Security Note

## Important Security Considerations

This course focuses on educational web scraping. When applying these techniques:

1. **Always respect robots.txt**: Check and follow the website's robots.txt file
2. **Rate limiting**: Implement delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
3. **User-Agent headers**: Use appropriate User-Agent strings
4. **Terms of Service**: Read and comply with website terms of service
5. **Legal compliance**: Ensure your scraping activities comply with local laws

## Ethical Guidelines

- Only scrape publicly available data
- Don't attempt to bypass authentication or access controls
- Cache responses to minimize repeated requests
- Consider the website's server resources

## Best Practices

- Use APIs when available instead of scraping
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Monitor and log your scraping activities
- Be prepared to stop if requested by the website owner

Remember: With great scraping power comes great responsibility!
