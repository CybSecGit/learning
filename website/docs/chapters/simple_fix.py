## The AI Pattern Revolution

### Why Most AI Implementations Are Like Using a Chainsaw to Butter Toast

Let me tell you a little secret: 90% of AI implementations in the wild are absolute garbage. Not because AI is bad, but because people use it like a magic wand instead of a sophisticated tool that requires actual thought.

**The Current State of AI Usage:**
```python
# What most people do (the chainsaw approach)
def solve_everything_with_ai(problem: str) -> str:
    return openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user", 
            "content": f"Fix this: {problem}"
        }]
    ).choices[0].message.content

# Cost: $500/month
# Reliability: "It works sometimes"
# Maintainability: "What maintainability?"
```

This is a test chapter to verify MDX compilation works.
