# Design Showcase

This page demonstrates the enhanced styling inspired by bun.com/docs and pls.cli.rs design analysis.

## Enhanced Typography and Code Blocks

Here's how different elements look with the new styling:

### Python Code Example

```python
def calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.
    
    Args:
        n: The position in the Fibonacci sequence
        
    Returns:
        The nth Fibonacci number
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    # Use dynamic programming for efficiency
    prev, curr = 0, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        prev, curr = curr, prev + curr
    
    return curr

# Example usage
result = calculate_fibonacci(10)
print(f"The 10th Fibonacci number is: {result}")
```

### Bash Commands

```bash
# Docker development workflow
docker-compose up -d
make test
make lint

# Run specific test
pytest course/tests/test_fibonacci.py::test_fibonacci_calculation -v
```

## Enhanced Admonitions

:::tip Success Checkpoint
You've successfully implemented the Fibonacci algorithm! This demonstrates understanding of:
- Dynamic programming concepts
- Type hints in Python
- Efficient algorithmic thinking
:::

:::note Learning Objective
Understanding how design systems work is crucial for creating maintainable and scalable user interfaces. The CSS custom properties system allows for consistent theming across components.
:::

:::warning Important Consideration
When implementing production security measures, never hardcode secrets in your source code. Always use environment variables and proper secret management systems.
:::

:::danger Security Alert
SQL injection vulnerabilities can be prevented by using parameterized queries. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings.

## Enhanced Tables

| Feature | Bun.com/docs | pls.cli.rs | Our Implementation |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Color System** | Gradient-based | Semantic variables | Combined approach |
| **Typography** | System fonts | Clean hierarchy | Enhanced readability |
| **Performance** | Modern effects | Lightweight | Balanced approach |
| **Responsive** | Good | Excellent | Mobile-first |

## Interactive Elements

The enhanced styling includes:

- Smooth hover transitions on navigation items
- Gradient text effects on headings
- Enhanced code block styling with better syntax highlighting
- Improved table design with alternating row colors
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Code with Inline Highlights

When working with `docker-compose up -d`, you'll notice that the inline code styling has been enhanced with subtle gradients and better contrast. The `make test` command will run your test suite, and `pytest --coverage` provides detailed coverage reports.

## Real-World Application

This design system was specifically crafted for a **Development Skills Laboratory** context, focusing on:

1. **Enhanced readability** for technical documentation
2. **Clear visual hierarchy** for learning progression
3. **Improved code presentation** for better comprehension
4. **Responsive design** for learning on any device
5. **Accessibility considerations** including reduced motion preferences

The result is a documentation site that feels modern and professional while maintaining excellent usability for learning programming concepts.
