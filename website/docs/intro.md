## 🎯 Course Philosophy

> **"The expert has failed more times than the beginner has even tried. Let's fail faster so we can succeed sooner."**

This course embraces the **Failure-Driven Development** methodology. Instead of showing you perfect code that works the first time, we'll encounter real problems, debug them systematically, and learn from each failure.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- **Modern Web Scraping** with Python and ethical practices
- **Systematic Debugging** techniques for when things go wrong
- **Testing Strategies** that actually work in production
- **Stealth Techniques** for handling bot detection
- **AI-Assisted Development** with Claude and other tools
- **Production-Ready Code** with proper error handling

## 📚 Course Structure

## 🏁 Quick Start

Ready to jump in? Here's how to get started:

<div className="exercise-box">

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ installed
- Docker installed (for containerization chapter)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal/command line access

</div>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/changelogger
cd changelogger

# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip install -e .

# Verify installation
python -m changelogger --version
```

## 🎓 Learning Approach

This course is designed for:

- **Beginners** who want to learn web scraping the right way
- **Intermediate developers** looking to improve their debugging skills
- **Anyone** who wants to learn systematic problem-solving

### 💡 Key Principles

1. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster** - We'll break things intentionally to understand them better
2. **Real-World Focus** - Every example comes from actual scraping challenges
3. **Ethical First** - We always respect robots.txt and rate limits
4. **Test Everything** - If it's not tested, it's broken
5. **Document Failures** - Every bug teaches us something valuable

## 🤝 Community & Support

- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or ask questions
- **Discussions**: Share your success stories and failures
- **Pull Requests**: Contribute improvements to the course

## 📖 Course Notation

Throughout this course, you'll see these special callouts:

<div className="failure-story">

**💥 Failure Story**: Real debugging sessions where things went wrong and how we fixed them.

</div>

<div className="success-story">

**✨ Success Story**: Moments when everything clicked and worked perfectly.
