# GitHub GraphQL Security Exercises

Practice building security tools with GitHub's GraphQL API through hands-on exercises.

## Exercise 1: Basic Vulnerability Scanner

Build a GitHub GraphQL vulnerability scanner that can authenticate, query repository vulnerabilities, and generate security reports.

### Learning Objectives
- Set up secure GitHub GraphQL authentication
- Write basic GraphQL queries for security data
- Handle API responses and error cases
- Generate actionable security insights

### Exercise File
The exercise is available as a Python script with TODO sections for you to implement:

```python
# Download the exercise file:
# course/exercises/github-graphql-security-exercise-01.py
```

Key features to implement:
- Token validation
- Repository vulnerability scanning
- Vulnerability categorization by severity
- Security report generation

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with repository access
- Personal access token with `security_events` scope
- Python 3.8+ with requests library

## Exercise 2: Advanced Security Analysis

Build an enterprise-grade security analyzer for GitHub organizations with policy evaluation and executive reporting.

### Learning Objectives
- Advanced GraphQL queries with pagination
- Security policy implementation and evaluation
- Risk assessment and prioritization algorithms
- Executive-level reporting and dashboards

### Exercise File
```python
# Download the exercise file:
# course/exercises/github-graphql-security-exercise-02.py
```

Key features to implement:
- Organization-wide repository discovery
- Custom security policy evaluation
- Risk scoring algorithms
- Executive security reports

### Prerequisites
- Completion of Exercise 1
- GitHub organization access or multiple repositories
- Understanding of security frameworks

## Setting Up Your Environment

### 1. Create GitHub Personal Access Token

Navigate to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Generate new token

Required scopes:
- `repo` - Access to repository data
- `read:org` - Read organization membership
- `security_events` - Read security events

### 2. Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Create .env file
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token_here
export GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=repository_owner
export GITHUB_REPO_NAME=repository_name
export GITHUB_ORG=organization_name  # For exercise 2
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install requests python-dotenv pydantic
```

## Running the Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Scanner
```bash
python course/exercises/github-graphql-security-exercise-01.py
```

Expected output:
- Authentication validation
- Vulnerability scanning progress
- Security report with findings and recommendations

### Exercise 2: Advanced Analysis
```bash
python course/exercises/github-graphql-security-exercise-02.py
```

Expected output:
- Organization repository discovery
- Security policy evaluation results
- Executive security dashboard

## Testing Your Implementation

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock

# Run all tests
pytest course/tests/test_github_graphql_security_exercises.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest course/tests/test_github_graphql_security_exercises.py --cov=course.exercises --cov-report=html
```

## Bonus Challenges

### Exercise 1 Extensions
- Add dependency graph analysis
- Implement rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Add filtering by ecosystem (npm, pip, etc.)
- Create a CLI interface with argparse
- Support scanning multiple repositories

### Exercise 2 Extensions
- Add compliance framework mapping (ISO 27001, SOC 2)
- Implement trend analysis with historical data
- Create HTML executive dashboard
- Add integration with security tools (Jira, Slack)
- Implement automated remediation suggestions

## Security Best Practices

When working with these exercises:

1. **Never commit tokens** - Use environment variables or secure vaults
2. **Use least privilege** - Only request necessary API scopes
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't expose sensitive information
4. **Implement rate limiting** - Respect GitHub's API limits
5. **Validate all inputs** - Prevent injection attacks
6. **Log security events** - Maintain audit trails

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises, explore:

1. **GitHub Actions Integration** - Automate security scanning
2. **Security Dashboards** - Build real-time monitoring
3. **Compliance Reporting** - Map to security frameworks
4. **Multi-Source Analysis** - Combine with other security APIs
5. **Machine Learning** - Add anomaly detection
