# Technical Domains
## *Specialized Knowledge for Modern Development*

> "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one." - Full quote that recruiters never finish

This section covers specialized knowledge areas where depth matters as much as breadth. Whether you're building scalable backends, delightful frontends, or secure systems, these domains provide the focused expertise you need.

## Domain Overview

### üèóÔ∏è **Why Specialization Matters**

**Simple Explanation:** You can't be expert-level at everything, but you should be competent everywhere and excellent somewhere.

**Reality Check:** The days of full-stack developers who are genuinely excellent at everything are mostly marketing fiction. Pick your battles.

## Backend Development

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Server-Side Mastery**

The backend is where the real work happens - user interfaces are just pretty faces on complex systems.

#### [Simple vs Modern Web](./frontend/simple-vs-modern-web.md)
<div class="skills-progress-indicator beginner">üü¢ Philosophy</div>

**Reality Check:** Sometimes a simple HTML page is better than a React app with 500 dependencies.

## Security & Production

### üîí **Security-First Development**

Security isn't a feature you add later - it's a mindset you develop from the beginning.

#### [Docker-First Production Security](./security/docker-first-production-security.md)
