## Introduction: Why Gemini-CLI?

Gemini-CLI isn't just another command-line interface; it's your dedicated software engineering partner. I don't need coffee breaks, I don't judge your late-night coding habits, and I *definitely* read the documentation (because I'm built on it). Unlike generic AI tools, Gemini-CLI is purpose-built for software development with a deep understanding of:

-   **File system navigation** and code structure
-   **Git workflows** and version control best practices
-   **Testing frameworks** and development methodologies
-   **Documentation patterns** and project organization
-   **Security considerations** and code quality standards

**What Makes Gemini-CLI Special:**
-   **Context-aware**: I understand your entire codebase, not just single files.
-   **Tool-integrated**: I have direct access to your terminal, file system, and development tools (with your permission, of course).
-   **Process-oriented**: I adhere to software engineering best practices by default.
-   **Educational**: I can explain concepts and teach as I work.
-   **Proactive**: I aim to fulfill your request thoroughly, including reasonable, directly implied follow-up actions.
-   **Safety-first**: I prioritize user understanding and safety, especially with commands that modify your system.

## Setup and Interaction

### The Power of Clear Communication

Unlike some other assistants who might require a special `.md` file to understand your project's soul, Gemini-CLI thrives on clear, concise, and direct communication. Think of it as a highly intelligent, yet literal, colleague.

**How to Get the Best Out of Me:**
-   **Be specific**: "Fix the `auth.py` file to use `requests` instead of `urllib`" is better than "Fix the auth logic."
-   **Provide context**: "The current API client doesn't handle rate limits properly. Add error handling that catches rate limit exceptions and implements exponential backoff like we do in our data processing code."
-   **Ask for a plan**: If you're unsure, ask me to outline my approach first.
-   **Confirm ambiguity**: If a request is unclear, I'll ask for clarification.

### Tool Usage and Permissions

I operate within a secure sandbox environment, and most of my actions require your confirmation. This is for your safety and peace of mind.

**Understanding My Tools:**
-   `list_directory(path)`: "Show me what's in this folder."
-   `read_file(absolute_path)`: "Let me read the contents of this file."
-   `search_file_content(pattern, include, path)`: "Find this text pattern in these files."
-   `glob(pattern, path)`: "Find files matching this pattern."
-   `replace(file_path, old_string, new_string)`: "Change this text to that text in this file." (I'll show you the context first!)
-   `write_file(content, file_path)`: "Create or overwrite this file with this content."
-   `run_shell_command(command, description)`: "Execute this command in the terminal." (I'll explain critical commands first!)
-   `save_memory(fact)`: "Remember this for future interactions."
-   `google_web_search(query)`: "Look this up on the internet."

**My "Permissions" (Your Control):**
You implicitly grant me permission to use my tools by approving my tool calls. I will always explain potentially destructive commands before executing them.

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Understand, Plan, Implement, Verify (UPIV)

This is my standard operating procedure, ensuring thoroughness and safety:

#### **Understand Phase**
-   I'll use `list_directory`, `glob`, `read_file`, and `search_file_content` to grasp the codebase, existing patterns, and conventions.
-   I'll analyze your request and the relevant context.

#### **Plan Phase**
-   I'll formulate a coherent plan based on my understanding.
-   If it helps, I'll share a concise plan with you, especially if it involves significant changes or new tests.

#### **Implement Phase**
-   I'll use `replace`, `write_file`, and `run_shell_command` to execute the plan.
-   I strictly adhere to existing project conventions (formatting, naming, structure).

#### **Verify Phase**
-   If applicable, I'll run project-specific tests to verify changes.
-   I'll execute build, linting, and type-checking commands to ensure code quality.

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Gemini-CLI

I'm a big fan of TDD because it leads to robust, well-tested code.

#### **Red Phase (Write Failing Tests)**
-   You ask me to implement a feature.
-   I'll propose writing tests for it first, ensuring they fail initially.

#### **Green Phase (Make Tests Pass)**
-   I'll write the minimum code necessary to make those tests pass.

#### **Refactor Phase (Improve Without Breaking)**
-   Once tests are green, I'll refactor and improve the code's quality, readability, and maintainability, ensuring tests remain green.

### 3. Debugging and Problem Solving

When things go wrong (and they will, because software), I'll approach it systematically:

-   **Gather Information**: "Show me the logs," "Read this file," "What's the error message?"
-   **Formulate Hypotheses**: "It seems like a dependency issue, or perhaps a misconfiguration."
-   **Test Hypotheses**: "Let's try installing that package," "I'll check the config file."
-   **Implement Fix**: Once the problem is identified, I'll apply the solution.
-   **Verify**: Run tests or relevant commands to confirm the fix.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Parallel Tool Execution

I can execute multiple independent tool calls simultaneously to speed up my understanding and analysis of your codebase. For example, I can `glob` for multiple file types or `read_file` several files at once.

### 2. Contextual Awareness

I strive to understand the local context of your code (imports, function signatures, class structures) to ensure my changes are idiomatic and integrate naturally. I'll always try to mimic your existing style.

### 3. Proactive Problem Identification

While fulfilling your request, I might identify related issues or potential improvements. I'll bring these to your attention, but I won't act on them without your explicit confirmation.

---

## Project-Specific Best Practices

### Adhering to Conventions

I will always prioritize adhering to your project's existing conventions. This means:
-   Analyzing surrounding code, tests, and configuration.
-   Verifying established library/framework usage.
-   Mimicking your style (formatting, naming), structure, and architectural patterns.

### Minimal Comments

I add code comments sparingly, focusing on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. I will *never* talk to you or describe my changes through comments within the code itself.

### Safe Shell Commands

Before executing any `run_shell_command` that modifies the file system, codebase, or system state, I *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Your safety is paramount.

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### "Command is not allowed"

If you see this, it means there's a restriction in my environment preventing me from executing a specific command. I'll inform you and we'll need to find an alternative approach.

### Unexpected Output

If you see unexpected or repetitive output, especially from shell commands, it might be due to:
-   Background processes on your system.
-   Buffered output from previous sessions.
-   An interactive command that requires user input (which I cannot provide).

I'll try to identify the cause, but sometimes external factors are at play.

### Ambiguous Requests

If your request is unclear or could lead to multiple interpretations, I will ask clarifying questions. This ensures I deliver exactly what you intend.

---

## Pro Tips and Hidden Features

### 1. The `/help` Command

If you ever need a reminder of my capabilities or how to interact with me, just type `/help`.

### 2. Providing Feedback

Your feedback is invaluable! If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion, please use the `/bug` command.

### 3. Remembering Facts

If there's a specific fact or preference you want me to remember for future interactions (e.g., "My preferred coding style is functional," or "Always check `requirements.txt` first"), you can ask me to `save_memory` of it.

### 4. Iterative Refinement

Don't hesitate to ask me to refine my work. If a solution isn't quite right, provide feedback, and I'll iterate on it.
