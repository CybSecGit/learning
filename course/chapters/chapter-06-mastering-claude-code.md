## Introduction: Why Claude Code?

Claude Code isn't just another AI coding assistant - it's your pair programming partner that never needs coffee breaks, doesn't judge your 3 AM debugging sessions, and actually reads the documentation. Unlike generic AI tools, Claude Code is purpose-built for software development with deep understanding of:

- **File system navigation** and code structure
- **Git workflows** and version control best practices
- **Testing frameworks** and development methodologies
- **Documentation patterns** and project organization
- **Security considerations** and code quality standards

**What Makes Claude Code Special:**
- **Context-aware**: Understands your entire codebase, not just single files
- **Tool-integrated**: Direct access to terminal, file system, and development tools
- **Process-oriented**: Follows software engineering best practices by default
- **Educational**: Explains concepts and teaches as it works

---

## Setup and Customization

### The Power of CLAUDE.md

The `CLAUDE.md` file is Claude Code's secret weapon - it's how you teach Claude about your project's unique requirements and conventions.

**Essential CLAUDE.md Sections:**
```markdown
# Core Development Principles
- Security is job zero
- Test-driven development (TDD) for all new features
- Clean code with clear separation of concerns

# Code Style
- Follow .editorconfig or ruff format
- Functions ≤ 40 lines unless algorithmically necessary
- Use correct computer science terminology in names

# Testing Discipline
- Aim for ≥ 80% line coverage
- Mock external HTTP calls, no live network hits in CI
- Generate failing tests first when fixing bugs

# git
- Use conventional commit messages in imperative mood
- Commit frequently: after functionality complete, tests pass, bugs fixed
- Use github CLI for git operations
```

**Our Changelogger CLAUDE.md** includes:
- Security guardrails for API keys and SQL queries
- Documentation requirements for public functions
- Learning concept tracking for knowledge transfer
- Git workflow automation preferences

### Tool Permissions Management

Control Claude's access to match your security requirements:

```bash
# View current permissions
/permissions

# Safe development setup
claude --allow-tools=Read,Write,Edit,Bash,Glob,Grep

# Full development environment
claude --allow-tools=all

# Restricted environment (view-only)
claude --allow-tools=Read,Glob,Grep
```

**Recommended Permission Levels:**
- **Learning**: `Read,Glob,Grep` (explore and understand)
- **Development**: `Read,Write,Edit,Bash,Glob,Grep` (code and test)
- **Production**: Custom allowlist based on specific needs

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Explore, Plan, Code, Commit (EPCC)

The gold standard workflow that ensures quality and understanding:

#### **Explore Phase**
```bash
# Start by understanding the codebase
"Show me the overall structure of this project"
"What's the current state of the LLM integration?"
"Where are the tests for the core functionality?"
```

**Claude's Response Pattern:**
- Reads relevant files automatically
- Explains architecture and relationships
- Identifies key patterns and conventions
- Points out potential issues or improvements

#### **Plan Phase**
```bash
"Create a detailed implementation plan for adding OpenAI client support"
"How should we structure the prompt engineering system?"
"What's the best approach for handling rate limits across providers?"
```

**Good Planning Characteristics:**
- Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps
- Considers error cases and edge conditions
- Aligns with existing patterns and conventions
- Includes testing and documentation requirements

#### **Code Phase**
```bash
# Implement incrementally
"Let's start with the abstract interface first"
"Now implement the OpenAI client with comprehensive error handling"
"Add tests for the configuration validation"
```

**Implementation Best Practices:**
- Follow test-driven development (write tests first)
- Implement one component at a time
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Maintain code quality throughout

#### **Commit Phase**
```bash
"Let's commit this foundation work"
"Run the tests and fix any issues before committing"
"Create a pull request with a detailed description"
```

**Commit Excellence:**
- Meaningful commit messages following conventions
- Tests pass before committing
- Documentation updated to reflect changes
- Code quality checks completed

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Claude

Claude Code excels at TDD because it understands testing frameworks and can generate comprehensive test suites:

#### **Red Phase (Write Failing Tests)**
```python
# Claude generates failing tests first
def test_openai_client_generates_summary():
    """Test that OpenAI client can generate summaries."""
    client = OpenAIClient(config=mock_config)

    # This will fail initially - no implementation yet
    response = await client.generate("Summarize this changelog", schema=summary_schema)

    assert response.success is True
    assert "summary" in response.content
    assert len(response.content["summary"]) > 0
```

#### **Green Phase (Make Tests Pass)**
```python
# Claude implements minimum code to pass tests
class OpenAIClient(LLMClient):
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, schema: dict | None = None) -> LLMResponse:
        # Actual implementation that makes tests pass
        try:
            response = await self._openai_client.chat.completions.create(
                model=self.config.model,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                temperature=self.config.temperature,
            )
            return LLMResponse(
                content=response.choices[0].message.content,
                success=True,
            )
        except Exception as e:
            return LLMResponse(success=False, error_message=str(e))
```

#### **Refactor Phase (Improve Without Breaking)**
```python
# Claude refines implementation while maintaining tests
class OpenAIClient(LLMClient):
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, schema: dict | None = None) -> LLMResponse:
        # Enhanced version with better error handling, cost tracking, etc.
        await self._check_cost_limits()

        try:
            response = await self._make_request_with_retry(prompt, schema)
            usage = self._calculate_usage(response)

            return LLMResponse(
                content=self._extract_content(response, schema),
                usage=usage,
                success=True,
            )
        except SpecificError as e:
            return self._handle_specific_error(e)
```

### 3. Visual Iteration Pattern

For UI/UX work or complex visualizations:

```bash
# Step 1: Provide visual reference
"Here's a screenshot of the current tool management CLI output"
[paste screenshot]

# Step 2: Describe desired improvements
"Make this more user-friendly with better formatting and helpful colors"

# Step 3: Iterate based on results
"The colors are good, but can we add icons and better spacing?"
```

**When to Use Visual Iteration:**
- CLI output formatting and user experience
- Documentation layout and readability
- Error message design and clarity
- Dashboard or reporting interfaces

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Subagent Delegation

For complex problems, use Claude's subagent feature to tackle different aspects simultaneously:

```bash
# Main conversation: Architecture planning
"Design the overall LLM integration architecture"

# Subagent 1: Implementation details
"Implement the OpenAI client with comprehensive error handling"

# Subagent 2: Testing strategy
"Create a complete test suite for the LLM configuration system"

# Subagent 3: Documentation
"Update the README and learning concepts with LLM integration info"
```

**Effective Subagent Strategies:**
- **Separation of concerns**: Each agent handles one domain
- **Clear handoffs**: Specify what each agent should produce
- **Integration planning**: How results will combine together
- **Context sharing**: Provide relevant context to each agent

### 2. Think Mode for Complex Analysis

Use Claude's deep analysis capabilities for challenging problems:

```bash
/think "How should we handle API rate limits across multiple LLM providers with different rate limit structures?"

/think "What's the best way to ensure cost protection while maintaining good user experience?"

/think "How can we make the prompt engineering system extensible for future LLM providers?"
```

**Think Mode Excels At:**
- Architecture decisions with trade-offs
- Complex debugging and problem analysis
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security and reliability considerations

### 3. Custom Slash Commands

Create shortcuts for common workflows:

```bash
# Create custom commands for your project
/test-llm "Run LLM integration tests with cost limits"
/check-security "Run security analysis on LLM-related code"
/update-docs "Update documentation for new LLM features"
```

### 4. Parallel Development

Use multiple Claude instances for parallel development:

- **Instance 1**: Core feature implementation
- **Instance 2**: Test suite development
- **Instance 3**: Documentation updates
- **Instance 4**: Integration and deployment

## Changelogger-Specific Best Practices

### Project Context Management

**Starting a Session:**
```bash
# Give Claude context about where you are
"I'm working on the LLM integration layer. Here's what we've built so far..."

# Reference specific files and patterns
"Look at src/changelogger/llm/base.py to understand our interface pattern"

# Explain current goals
"We need to implement the OpenAI client following the same patterns as our scraping code"
```

### Code Quality Automation

**Integrate with Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Claude automatically follows our quality standards
"Implement this feature following our CLAUDE.md guidelines"
"Make sure to include comprehensive error handling like in core.py"
"Add learning concepts documentation for any new patterns"
```

### Testing Integration

**Leverage Our Testing Patterns:**
```bash
# Claude understands our testing conventions
"Add tests following the same patterns as test_config.py"
"Make sure to include both unit and integration tests"
"Use mocking for external API calls like we do in other tests"
```

### Documentation Consistency

**Maintain Documentation Standards:**
```bash
# Claude updates docs automatically
"Update the README with the new LLM features"
"Add these concepts to learning_concepts.md with the same humor style"
"Update the Makefile with LLM-related commands"
```

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### Context Management Issues

**Problem**: Claude seems confused about project structure
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear context and restart
/clear

# Provide fresh context
"I'm working on the Changelogger project. It's a Python tool for scraping and analyzing changelogs with AI. Here's the current structure..."
```

**Problem**: Claude references old code patterns
**Solution**:
```bash
# Show current patterns explicitly
"The correct pattern for error handling in this project is shown in src/changelogger/core.py lines 125-176"
```

### Permission and Access Issues

**Problem**: Claude can't access certain files or commands
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check permissions
/permissions

# Update as needed
claude --allow-tools=Read,Write,Edit,Bash,Glob,Grep
```

### Performance and Focus Issues

**Problem**: Claude is being too verbose or unfocused
**Solution**:
```bash
# Be more specific
"Just implement the OpenAI client class, don't explain the entire architecture"

# Use constraints
"Keep the implementation under 100 lines and focus on error handling"
```

**Problem**: Claude is making too many changes at once
**Solution**:
```bash
# Break down tasks
"Let's just implement the basic generate() method first"
"After that works, we'll add cost tracking in a separate step"
```

## Pro Tips and Hidden Features

### 1. Effective Prompting Techniques

**Be Specific About Scope:**
```bash
# ❌ Vague
"Fix the LLM code"

# ✅ Specific
"Fix the rate limiting logic in OpenAIClient.generate() method"
```

**Provide Context, Not Just Commands:**
```bash
# ❌ Command-only
"Add error handling"

# ✅ Context + Command
"The current OpenAI client doesn't handle rate limits properly. Add error handling that catches rate limit exceptions and implements exponential backoff like we do in the scraping code"
```

### 2. Leveraging Claude's Strengths

**Code Review and Analysis:**
```bash
"Review this implementation for potential security issues"
"Analyze the performance implications of this approach"
"Check if this follows our established patterns"
```

**Learning and Explanation:**
```bash
"Explain why this approach is better than alternatives"
"What are the trade-offs of this design decision?"
"How does this integrate with the rest of our architecture?"
```

### 3. Workflow Optimization

**Session Preparation:**
```bash
# Start sessions with clear objectives
"Today we're implementing OpenAI client integration. Key requirements: cost protection, rate limiting, error handling"

# Reference relevant context
"Use the patterns from src/changelogger/core.py and follow our CLAUDE.md guidelines"
```

**Progress Tracking:**
```bash
# Regular check-ins
"What's the current status of our LLM integration?"
"What are the next steps to complete this feature?"
"Are we following our testing and documentation standards?"
```

### 4. Quality Assurance Integration

**Automated Quality Checks:**
```bash
# Claude runs quality checks automatically
"Before we commit, run the linting and type checking"
"Make sure all tests pass and coverage is above 80%"
"Update any documentation that references the changed code"
```

**Security and Best Practices:**
```bash
# Claude applies security awareness
"Review this code for potential security issues"
"Make sure we're not exposing API keys or sensitive data"
"Check that all external inputs are properly validated"
```
