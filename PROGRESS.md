# Progress Log - Plan 5: Makefile Mastery & Next.js Development

## Current Task
Creating comprehensive learning plan for Makefile mastery and Next.js development

## Actions Taken

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis
- [x] Searched for existing learning path files and curriculum structure
- [x] Analyzed writing style and humor patterns in existing documentation
- [x] Examined sidebar structure in sidebars.js
- [x] Reviewed existing learning plans (especially Plan 4) for format consistency
- [x] Checked for existing Makefile and Next.js content

### Phase 2: Main Content Creation
- [x] Created main learning plan file: `/website/docs/learning-plans/plan-5-makefile-nextjs.md`
  - Followed established format with modules, cost estimates, and tool lists
  - Maintained consistent writing style with humor and practical metaphors
  - Included 7 modules plus debugging guide
  - Added proper frontmatter and structure

### Phase 3: Supporting Files Creation (Completed)
- [x] Update sidebars.js to include Plan 5
- [x] Create setup.md file
- [x] Create module-1.md file
- [x] Create module-2.md file
- [x] Create module-3.md file
- [x] Create module-4.md file
- [x] Create module-5.md file
- [x] Create module-6.md file
- [x] Create module-7.md file
- [x] Create debugging-guide.md file
- [x] Create troubleshooting.md file
- [x] Update learning plans index to reflect Plan 5 is now active
- [x] Fix Plan numbering in future plans section

### Phase 4: Quality Checks (Completed)
- [x] All files created with consistent formatting
- [x] Sidebar structure properly nested
- [x] All internal links follow correct pattern
- [x] Consistent writing style maintained

### Phase 5: Git Operations (Completed)
- [x] Stage all changes
- [x] Create meaningful commit

## Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive learning plan for Makefile mastery and Next.js development:

- **Total Files Created**: 13 files
- **Main Plan**: plan-5-makefile-nextjs.md
- **7 Module Files**: Covering everything from Makefile basics to production deployment
- **Setup Guide**: Detailed environment configuration
- **Debugging Guide**: Comprehensive troubleshooting for common issues
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Quick fixes and solutions
- **Updated Files**: sidebars.js and learning plans index

The learning plan maintains consistency with the existing documentation style while providing a thorough, practical curriculum for mastering both Makefile automation and modern Next.js development.

## Notes
- Maintained the irreverent, practical tone established in other documentation
- Focused on real-world applications rather than theoretical knowledge
- Cost estimates are realistic for Next.js development
- Module progression follows logical learning path from CLI automation to full-stack development
